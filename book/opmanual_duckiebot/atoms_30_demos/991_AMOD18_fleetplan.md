This is the template for the description of a fleet planning demonstration. These guideline aim to run a simulator platform for the fleet planning algorithm. The fleet planning algorithm is further referred as dispatcher. The diagram below shows the architecture of the simulator software stack. (Box diagram descrbing the simulator architecture)

  

First, we describe what is needed, including:

  

* Basic knowledge of fleet planning

* Dispatcher algorithm (Demo can be run with basic open source dispatcher)

* ROS message definition of dispatcher must be same as existing onces.

* ROS full package installed in your laptop

  

<div class='requirements' markdown="1">

  

Requires: Duckiebot in configuration ???

  

Requires: Camera calibration completed.

  

</div>

  

## Video of expected results {#demo-fleetplan-expected}

  

First, we show a video of the expected behavior (if the demo is succesful).

  

## Duckietown setup notes {#demo-fleetplan-duckietown-setup}

  

Here, describe the assumptions about the Duckietown, including:

  

* Layout (tiles types)

* Instrastructure (traffic lights, wifi networks, ...) required

* Weather (lights, ...)

  

Do not write instructions here. The instructions should be somewhere in [the part about Duckietowns](+opmanual_duckietown#duckietowns). Here, merely point to them.

  
  

## Duckiebot setup notes {#demo-fleetplan-duckiebot-setup}

  

Write here any special setup for the Duckiebot, if needed.

  
  

Do not write instructions here. The instructions should be somewhere in the appropriate setup part.

  
  

## Pre-flight checklist {#demo-fleetplan-pre-flight}

  

The pre-flight checklist describes the steps that are sufficient to

ensure that the demo will be correct:

  

Check: operation 1 done

  

Check: operation 2 done

  

## Demo instructions {#demo-fleetplan-run}

  

Here, give step by step instructions to reproduce the demo.

  

Step 1: XXX

  

Step 2: XXX

  
  

## Troubleshooting {#demo-fleetplan-troubleshooting}

  

Add here any troubleshooting / tips and tricks required.

  

## Demo failure demonstration {#demo-fleetplan-failure}

  

Finally, put here a video of how the demo can fail, when the assumptions are not respected.
